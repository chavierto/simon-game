# Project #1: Simon

A game in HTML, CSS and JS developed by Xavier Luj√°n.

## Project description

The game I'm developing is Simon. It's a single player game in which the user is tasked with remembering a sequence of colors that gets longer with each turn. The game continues as long as the player inputs the correct sequence. Once they make a mistake, the game ends and the score will be equal to the number of turns that the game lasted.
